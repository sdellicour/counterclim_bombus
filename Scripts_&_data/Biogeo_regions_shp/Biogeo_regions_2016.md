# Biogeographical regions, Europe 2016, ver. 1

The biogeographical regions dataset contains the official delineations used in the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and for the EMERALD Network set up under the Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats (Bern Convention).

The Pannonian region of Serbia was missing in previous versions and this has been corrected in the 2016 version. Some Arctic islands which do not belong to the European part of Russia and which were erroneously included in previous versions have been removed.https://sdi.eea.europa.eu/geonetwork/srv/api/records/c6d27566-e699-4d58-a132-bbe3fe01491b
