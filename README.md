Impact of climate change on European bumblebees
===============

This repo gathers the input files and scripts related to our study entitled "**Evaluating the impact of climate change on the decline of European bumblebee populations**" (De Tandt *et al*. *submitted*). R scripts used to conduct the different ecological niche modelling and projections described in that study are all available in `Script_ENM_study.r`.

**Figure 1. Investigating the changes in ecological suitability for bumblebees in regard to climate change over the last century in Europe.** We here report, for each period, the difference between the bumblebee ecological suitability estimates based on (i) the reconstructions of the historical climate and (ii) a counterfactual baseline. Specifically, we focus on two distinct metrics: the ecological suitability index (ESI) defined as the local mean ecological suitability averaged over species (and thus ranging from 0 to 1; **A**), as well as the species richness index (SRI) defined as the local number of species associated with an ecological suitability higher than the median threshold value retrieved from the optimisation step of the prevalence-pseudoabsence-calibrated Sørensen index (SI<sub>ppc</sub>) computed for each of ten ecological niche models trained on present-day data (see the Material and Methods section for further detail; **B**). The computation of both ESI and SRI metrics was thus based on species-specific ecological suitability maps, which were obtained by averaging over the estimates of ten independent BRT models trained on present-day data retrieved from the ISIMIP3a reanalysis dataset GSWP3-W5E5 (see Figure S5 for the maps reporting the absolute ESI and SRI values for this reanalysis dataset, as well as Figures S6-S8 for the corresponding results based on the three other ISIMIP3a reanalysis datasets — 20CRv3, 20CRv3-ERA5, and 20CRv3-W5E5 — considered in the present study).
